        <h1>Hey Mona,</h1>
        <p>Looks like you've stumbled onto a tricky little trap! Don't worry, it's just me pulling your leg with a friendly phishing test. ðŸ˜„</p>
        <p class="warning">But hey, while we're here, let's talk about the dos and don'ts of clicking random links online:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't Be Too Trusting:</strong> Just like how you're skeptical when I say I'll only take five minutes in the store, always approach unfamiliar links with caution.</li>
            <li><strong>Do Verify:</strong> If a link seems fishy (pun intended), don't hesitate to double-check with me or Google before clicking. It's better to be safe than sorry!</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Sharp:</strong> Keep those cyber-sleuthing skills sharp! Scammers are getting sneakier, so it's essential to stay one step ahead.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we've had our laugh, remember that your online safety is no joke. If you ever have doubts about a link or need some backup, you know I've got your back!</p>
        <p>Keep smiling (and clicking wisely),</p>
        <p>Shuby</p>
